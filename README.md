# orison-web (Stellate Web Demo)
This repo also includes a zero-install browser build of a Stellate MVP demo under `orison-web/`.

## Run
- Open `orison-web/index.html` directly in a browser.

If the browser blocks local file access for any assets, serve the folder with a local static server.

## Controls
- Move: WASD / Arrow Keys
- Jump: Space
- Interact (Cartesian-Twist switch): E
- Pause: Esc

## 3D Protagonist Overlay (WebGL)
The demo renders a procedural 3D “Afronaut” protagonist in a WebGL overlay canvas on top of the 2D game.

## Export the protagonist as `.glb`
While the demo is running, press `G` to download `stellate_protagonist.glb`.
